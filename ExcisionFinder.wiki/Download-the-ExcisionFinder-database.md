The ExcisionFinder database (20 GB) is available for download [here](http://lighthouse.ucsf.edu/public_files_no_password/excisionFinderData_public/). However, for many uses, you will only need part of it. Please refer to your use case in the [tutorials](https://github.com/keoughkath/ExcisionFinder/blob/master/README.md) to determine whether you want to download everything or only some things.
